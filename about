SH DESCRIPTION

Shell is a UNIX term for an interactive user interface with an operating system. The shell is the programmatic layer  that 
 understands  and executes commands entered by the user. On some systems, the shell is called the command interpreter.

The simple shell is a command that reads lines from  a file or  terminal, interprets them, and usually executes other commands. This is a program that runs when a user logs into the system. It contains many features to facilitate interactive use and has the advantage that the interpreter language is the same for interactive and non-interactive  (shell script) applications. This means that commands can be typed directly into a simple running shell, or placed in a file that can be run directly from a  simple shell.

Always 0 for success, other number means failure.
